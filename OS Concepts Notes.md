# Chapter 1  Overview
## Computer System  
1. hardware  
(Basic computing resources)  
 * CPU(central processing unit)  
 * memory  
 * I/O devices  
2. operating system  
(controls the hardware and coordinates its use among the various application programs for various users)   
Similar to the government, only provides an *__environment__* within which other programs can do useful work   
3. application programs  
(defines the ways in which these resources are used to solve users' computing problems)   
4. users  

## User point of view  

1. *PC*  
mostly for **ease of use** for **single user**  
with *some attention to performance* and *none to resource utilization*  
2. *terminals connected to the mainframe or minicomputer*  
maximize resource utilization (efficiently)  
no individual user takes more than her fair share.  
3. *workstations connected to the networks of other workstations or servers*  
compromise between individual usability and resource utilization.  
4. *Mobile computers*  
Interacts the system with the *touch screen* by pressing or swiping fingers  
5. *Embedded computers*  
are designed primarily to run without user intervention.  


## System point of view  

1. *Resource Allocator*
2. *Control program prevent errors and improper use of computer (IO)*

## Brief history of OS
The fundamental goal of computer systems is to execute user programs and to make solving user problems easier.  
Computer hardware is constructed toward this goal. Since bare hardware alone is not particularly easy to use, application programs are developed.  
These programs require certain common operations, such as those controlling the I/O devices.
The common functions of controlling and allocating resources are then brought together into one piece of software: the operating system.

*Kernel* System programs & application programs
(Associated with the OS, but not necessarily part of kernel)    
**OS** is the one program running at all times on the computerâ€”usually called the kernel

Nowadays, mobile OS include not only the kernel but also the *__middleware__*  
(a set of software frameworks that provide additional services to application developers)
